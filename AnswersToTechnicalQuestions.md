Q. How long did you spend on this coding assignment?

    I believe I have spent somewhere around 8 hours on this
    coding assignment.

Q. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

    I would add more styling to showcase some of my skills while also making the app look better. Add some effects when hovering on the button, or even hover on the images.  I would also like to have added some testing in my application.

Q. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

    For me , I would use the network panel in my dev tool. This tool will analyze the network activity and will detect possible causes.

Q. How would you improve the API that you just used?

    I honestly would just make the documentation easier to read. As soon as you visit the API, everything just looks as if it is just thrown there. I think proper navigation with this API could go a long way.
